{"name":"Adbe","tagline":"A simple CLI to extend some ADB commands on multiple devices","body":"# ADBe\r\n\r\nA simple Command-line interface (CLI) that builds upon the existing Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to \r\nprovide better support when dealing with running adb commands on more than one device.\r\n\r\nInspired by [Paulo Costa](https://github.com/paulombcosta) with [adb-extended](https://github.com/paulombcosta/adb-extended).\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nADB does not support some commands on multiple devices.\r\n\r\nIf you run a simple command like `adb shell` with multiple connected devices results in an error \r\nlike this:\r\n\r\n![ADB](./images/adb.png)\r\n\r\nBut if you run with adbe you will get this:\r\n\r\n![ADBe](./images/adbe.png)\r\n\r\nGiving the option to run this command on individual devices or on all of them.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n- Download project.\r\n- Move adbe.scala or adbe.rb file that is located in src to the folder you want and add to the path.\r\n- Now simply run the command `adbe`.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nADB, Scala 2.11.5 or greater or Ruby 2.2.1 or greater, in your PATH.\r\n\r\n## More\r\n\r\nFor more information on installing the scala check out facilities [page](./INSTALLATION.md).\r\n\r\nADBe is a work in progress, feel free to improve it.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nADBe is released under the MIT license.
